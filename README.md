# Homework

installation: 
pip install -r requirements.txt


there are two parts: 
First is 1-4 tasks and last one is the 5th task.
in test.py there is couple of tests 
For some tasks there is note,because I wanted to explain little bit what I did and some of the task were more about explaining.


If someone want to try it. Only run files fifth_task.py and call_homework_functions.py that would print results of tasks
